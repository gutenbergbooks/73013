<h2 class="nobreak">Introduction.</h2>
</div>


<p>This little work has been written in a hurry
amid the worry and pressure of professional duties.
It has also been ruthlessly cut down to compress
it within the space allotted by the publisher.
Neither profundity of matter, nor perfection of
style is aimed at. It is written in every-day language,
and may limp a little here and there. For
none of these faults do I offer an apology to my
readers. I ask them to take it as it is—as something
more than a mere introduction to a most interesting
and important subject.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">How to Mesmerize.</h2>
</div>


<p>It is generally believed that only weak-minded,
<em>soft</em>, and hysterical persons can be successfully
mesmerized—that persons of robust health, will,
and character cannot be so affected. There never
was a greater mistake. Reichenbach for many
years selected his sensitives from delicate and
hysterical persons while pursuing investigations
into odylic force. He, however, soon discovered his
error, and found that healthy men and women
made the best sensitives for his investigation.
Dr. Braid fell into the same error.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[3]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">More About Hypnotism.</h2>
</div>


<p>Charcot and others, including the whole range
of recent hypnotists, have revived this error. The
experience of all mesmerists—past and present—worthy
of the name is this: the healthier and
finer the organization, the more perfect and
exalted the manifestations.</p>

<p>There are relative conditions of superiority
and inferiority in mesmerists and sensitives
only. I have mesmerized men who were my
superiors in every way—health, strength of
body and mind—the only conditions of difference
consisting of this important fact, that for
the time being they approached the subject of
Mesmerism with open minds—a desire to get
at truth—and sat down with a non-resistant attitude
of mind, perfectly willing to be mesmerized,
and to record their own symptoms in connection
therewith, if possible. In the majority of
cases the seventh or eighth sitting suffices to
overcome all difficulties, and induce sleep in the
most healthy and vigorous. There have, however,
been exceptions to this. Don’t waste time with a
man who makes a bet through pride, vanity, or
ignorance, that he can’t be mesmerized. Don’t
waste health and energy trying to influence him
just then. His manner and words indicate that<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
he will arouse all his faculties to resist you, presenting
thereby positive and antagonistic mental
conditions for you to overcome. Men have done
this. If you really want to mesmerize them the
best plan is to throw them off their guard as to
your intentions. But as soon as their opposition
is cooled down a little, proceed <em>gently</em> and <em>steadily</em>
to <em>impress them</em> with what Mesmerism has
done and can do. Thus gradually and surely
psychologize them, leading up to and preparing
them for the final <i lang="fr">coup</i>. In the end it may not be
so difficult to mesmerize them as they at first
imagined. The persistent man of business, the
advocate of certain views—temperance, anti-slavery,
or what not—the man with “a mission,”
the doctor of medicine, preacher, and lover, all
adopt this method more or less unconsciously, because
naturally; the mesmerist, detecting the
law, applies it consciously—that is all.</p>

<p>In natural sleep the heart beats slower, the
pulses are calmer, there is less blood in the brain
than in the waking state. By mesmeric processes
you endeavor to bring about a similar physiological
condition—every magnetic pass determining
the result by retarding the flow of arterial blood to
the brain. Also in natural sleep the eyes are
turned upward and inward. A brief explanation
of the muscles of the eye, and how they influence
its movements, will be interesting. There are two
sets of muscles. The superior, or oblique muscles,
are involuntary in their action, and therefore are
not subject to the action of the will. The inferior
or straight muscles (of which there are four), are
attached at cardinal points to the eyeball, and by
their combined action the eyes are moved in every
direction required for vision. The latter muscles
are voluntary—that is, subject to the will of the<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
individual. Now, when the eyes are withdrawn
from the operations of the will, they are controlled
involuntarily by the oblique muscles, and turned
upward and inward. For instance, in intense joy,
in devotion, pain, sorrow, exhaustion, or bodily
weakness, the eyes are turned up. This arises
from the fact that the straight muscles resign
their action, and the oblique muscles operate in
their stead, and the eye is rolled upward under the
eyelid. In acknowledging the presence of a
superior, and in the act of bowing, the eyes are
“lifted up.” See a girl in happy thought pondering
on the future, a patient suffering from extreme
pain, the devotee at worship—be he idolater or
Christian, or the wearied one waiting for transition
to other and happier scenes on high—the same
characteristic is observed. Thus in sleep, in fainting,
or in approaching death, the phenomenon is
observed in all. The voluntary muscles resign
their action, insensibility prevails, and retina loses
expression, and the pupil is turned up as described.
Whatever contributes to this result, contributes to
sleep. The mesmeric operator avails himself of
this and the foregoing in his endeavors to induce
artificial sleep.</p>

<p>Hypnotists deliberately weary the inferior muscles
of the eyes, trusting to automatic inhibition
of the nerve centres for the results desired. Success
in certain directions indicates they are not far
astray. The mesmerist standing above his patient,
or sitting in a chair a little higher up than the
patient unconsciously leads to the same automatic
effect, but much more naturally. The hypnotist
will cause the subject to <em>strain his eyes at
an object</em>. The mesmerist desires his sensitive to
be seated comfortably, to look at him (the mesmerist),
and if the sensitive or patient feel inclined<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
to close his eyes, to do so, or to sleep, to do so—the
latter process being more in harmony with
nature than the former.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">How to Induce Sleep.</h2>
</div>


<p>Make your patient feel at home, disabuse his
mind of fear, doubt, anxiety, and scepticism.
(Mesmerise no one without the presence of some
one interested in the patient’s welfare—parents,
relatives, guardians, or medical adviser). Remove,
if possible, all elements which are likely to
arouse or excite the patient’s mind. To succeed,
the patient must either be naturally sensitive of
your <em>influence</em>—<i lang="la">i. e.</i>, passive and receptive—or he
must be made so. Everything you do must tend
to that condition. By action and speech—in everything
you must show you know fully what you
are about; there must be no timidity, hesitancy or
half-heartedness exhibited in your manner. You
must create the instinctive feeling in the mind of
your patient, “that is a man I can trust; that man
or person will do me good,” <em>and you will do it</em>.
You can proceed to mesmerize by any of the processes
already recorded, or you can adopt this
method, viz.—Let your patient be comfortably
placed or seated; sit or stand before him, or just
at his side. Ask him to pay no attention to his
friends or surroundings, but resign himself to
your care. He can either close his eyes, or look
to yours. Inform him if he feels any strange or
peculiar feelings—a sinking sensation, darkness of
vision, nervous tremulousness, drowsiness or an inclination
to sleep, not to resist but <em>give way</em>. It
will be all right, and you will see him through.</p>

<p>Next, for five minutes or so, take hold of his
hands in an easy, comfortable manner, or he can<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
place his hands upon his knees, and you can lay
yours with a just perceptible physical pressure on
the top of them. Remain thus in contact until
there is no apparent difference in temperature between
your hands and his. Direct your eyes to
his, or, rather, to the organ of “Individuality,” or
that portion of the head just situated between the
two eyebrows, at the root of the nose. Exercise
your <em>will</em> calmly and steadfastly toward the desired
end—sleep. Gradually remove your hands
from his, and place them on his head for two or
three minutes, covering his forehead at each temple
with the hollow of your hand, with fingers
resting on head and your thumbs converging toward
“Individuality.” Slight pressure with the
hands on the temples is desirable, as it tends to
check the inflow of blood to the head per the temporal
arteries. You will now proceed to further
<em>charge</em> the brain with your <em>influence</em> by passes
directed to that end, always downward over the
head and face,—forehead, tophead, sidehead, and
backhead,—all coming under your direction, so
far as such passes can be made with <em>direct intent</em>
and with ease and comfort. You will also facilitate
your purpose by pointing the <em>tips</em> of your
fingers toward the eyes and temples, but throughout
there must be neither vulgar staring nor thumb
pressure. You will continue making these movements
until the eyelids tremble, become heavy,
or close. In some cases it is advisable to close
the eyelids and fasten them by downward passes,
and thus hasten the result desired. When I say
hasten the result—viz., the mesmeric sleep of the
person operated on—I do not mean the mesmerist
to hasten; <em>he should never be in a hurry</em>. When
the patient has exhibited the signs mentioned, you
now proceed with both local and by general passes<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
<em>at distance</em> to abstract your influence (but not to
awaken your now-sensitive) by moving your hands
with fingers extended slowly from his head to his
fingers, both inside and outside the arms, also
from the forehead down in front of the body to
the pit of stomach, and then toward the knees.
At the termination of each pass raise the hands
(as described in practicing the passes) and commence
again. Continue these passes for some
time after he or she has apparently fallen asleep.</p>

<p>If you do not succeed at first, proceed at subsequent
sittings as if you had no previous failure;
and when <em>once</em> you succeed in putting a person
asleep your power to do so will be enhanced, and
your future percentages will increase in due proportion.
When you have obtained satisfactory
evidence of sleep, it is advisable to try no experiments
for the first two or three sittings, beyond
the following. Let the patient sleep on for some
time, and then quietly wake him up. <em>Don’t do it
suddenly.</em> You might spoil for ever a good subject
by so doing. Stand behind or before your
sensitive, and make slowly and then briskly upward
passes (palms of the hands up) <em>in front of
the face</em>, and blow steadily on the forehead, when
your patient will awake much surprised and benefitted
by the sleep. With a little more experience
you can arrange with your patient when he will
awake of his own accord. When this is done, the
sensitive will always awake at the time arranged.
This arrangement or experiment is capable of
considerable extension or modification.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Curative Mesmerism.</h2>
</div>


<p>The powers of the early Christians, whether
natural “gifts of healing,” or both, were intensified
by the simplicity and purity of their living, and
the reality of their faith. They doubted not, yet
where they doubted they could do no miracles.</p>

<p>The man who has “no heart” to relieve disease,
or, having sympathy, has no will to do so, is either
without the power to do good, or, doubting his
power, is unable to use it.</p>

<p>Where there is sympathy for suffering, the desire
to relieve or remove it, and the <em>will</em> to do so,
the <em>way</em> soon opens up, and the suffering <em>is</em> removed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[10]</span></p>

<p>The most powerful healers I ever came in contact
with had strong, healthy vital organizations,
and were large-hearted, kindly-disposed persons.</p>

<p>The weak, tender, and delicate, when the heart
and head work together, can accomplish much,
however. The tired mother, wearied with nursing,
does not lose her charm to sooth. Gentle and
tender, ever more thoughtful of others than herself,
<em>her diligent hands</em> bring peace and blessing
with them at all times.</p>

<p>Although delicate and sensitive females, from
their sympathetic and patient natures, have been
very successful in the treatment of disease—at
considerable loss to themselves, however—no one
should undertake to treat disease of a severe character
unless they have abundance of health and
vitality; and have also the determination, patience
and sympathy requisite to make them good healers.</p>

<p>Ladies make excellent healers, just as they
make the best nurses. The <em>gift</em> can be readily
cultivated by them, and by practice put to good
use. For many reasons woman would be the best
magnetizer for woman, man for man, husband
for wife, wife for husband, and father and mother
for children, etc.; but this cannot always be.</p>

<p>There is no reason why the professional healer,
male and female, should not be trusted and esteemed
as honorable in their work and position as
the physician or minister.</p>

<p>Wide and general experience enables me to declare
my undoubted conviction, that there is
scarcely any form of disease which may not be at
least relieved where not cured, by the steady, persevering,
and judicious use of the mesmeric processes.</p>

<p>Massage, shampooing, muscular and kinetic<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
movements, are but different modes of local mesmeric
treatment. These terms are more fashionable
in some quarters than the word Mesmerism—that
is of little consequence, if good is done.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">An Important Fact.</h2>
</div>


<p>This little book contains considerable information
regarding hypnotism, but if you want to learn
a great deal more send ten cents to Keystone
Book Co., Philadelphia, Pa., and ask for Lupton’s
book on mesmerism. It contains a vast amount
of secret information not printed in this.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Curative Processes.</h2>
</div>


<p>The mesmeric processes adopted in the cure of
disease are those of sleep, and when it is necessary
the application of remedies suggested by the sensitive
in sleep, or by your clairvoyant, in the case
of and for another patient.</p>

<p>In such cases, medicines may be ordered, baths
prescribed, rules of diet pointed out, or certain
processes of treatment ordered. And you will, if
satisfied with the <i lang="la">bona fides</i> of your sensitive’s
powers of diagnosis and general lucidity, faithfully
carry them out.</p>

<p>The mesmeric treatment for the cure of disease
may be purely local or general in character, exercised
solely with the intention to alleviate and
cure disease, without producing sleep, sleep not
being necessary in the majority of cases. If necessary,
you know how to bring it about.</p>

<p>Nothing is worth doing that is not worth doing
well. If you want to cure disease set about it, and
“whatever <em>your hands</em> find to do, do it with all
your might,” <i lang="la">i. e.</i>, put your <em>soul</em> into it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[12]</span></p>

<p>Avoid all experiments, and direct your attention,
energies, and, in fact, all your powers, to the
work—the most needed work—the cure of your
patient.</p>

<p>Remember, Mesmerism is not a <em>cure-all</em>. There
are diseases of such a character, arising from
hereditary taint, constitutional defects, and organic
causes, which can never be cured in this
world, only you, as a mesmerist, should not say so.</p>

<p>Give help when and where you can, according
to your strength. So that in these, medically and
humanely speaking, utterly hopeless and intractable
cases you are not to refuse aid, seeing there
are few cases where the mesmeric influence will
not soothe and relieve pain, quiet the nervous system,
restore sleep and strength in a large measure
and, what is not to be despised, impart a cheerful
and hopeful spirit to the patient.</p>

<p>In chronic and acute diseases, especially when
there is a periodicity in attack, sleep is recommended
to break that periodicity, and to lengthen
the intervals between attacks. In all mental,
psychological and highly nervous troubles sleep
is advised. When this is necessary, mesmerize by
the long pass from head to feet, the patient being
in bed, or lying upon the sofa, will materially
facilitate your operations.</p>

<p>You will soon begin to see the effects of your attendance
by the improvement in your patient.
When the patient “looks for you,” is impatient
for your visit and wearies for the next, it is not a
bad sign; it indicates your influence and presence
to be refreshing and restorative in character.</p>

<p>Good doctors and nurses have the same characteristics.</p>

<p>If your presence or influence is in any way disagreeable
to your patient, and upon the third or<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
fourth visit you are satisfied of this, give up the
treatment. You can do no good, although another
may. But do not give up a case simply because
favorable results are tardy in making their appearance.</p>

<p>Where your influence is not disagreeable, it is
your duty to persevere and hope for the best. You
cannot do harm, and you may do great good.</p>

<p>When there is nervousness and great debility,
operate from the head—back head—downward,
long passes at first, and then short passes locally.
If the action of the heart is weak, or palpitation
is characteristic, breathe in upon it at the termination
of each treatment.</p>

<p>You will be surprised at the warmth and generous
feeling transferred throughout your patient’s
organism in consequence.</p>

<p>You can subdue the most violent coughing fit by
steady and gently breathing upon the spine, just
between the shoulder blades of your patient—child
or adult.</p>

<p>So long as the clothing, under or upper, is not
made of silk, the breathing will be effectual.</p>

<p>The lungs should be fully expanded, the mouth
placed close to the part, as near as the clothing
will admit, and a strong, steady stream of breath
thrown in upon the place. The moment the mouth
is removed, the open hand should be placed over
the place while filling the lungs to repeat the
operation, which may be done several times.</p>

<p>In rheumatic and neuralgic derangements and
ailments of that class, and in cuttings, bruises,
and burns, the treatment is often purely local—the
passes following the course of the nerves of
sensation.</p>

<p><em>In mesmeric treatment it is just as well to remember
there is no need to remove the clothing<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
under any circumstances</em>, unless it is composed
of silk or other non-conducting material. <em>For
economical reasons old clothing is better than
new.</em></p>

<p>Toothache is a common affliction. You will
have many opportunities of immediately relieving
it, if not effectually and ultimately curing it.</p>

<p>A very good and practical method of cure is to
lay your hand upon the affected side of the face,
and hold it there for a few minutes, and this prepares
the face for the next movement. Then place
a piece of flannel over the ear (on the same side of
the head as the toothache); keep your hand still
on the face, but now over the flannel, with the
other hand over the head, holding the upper portion
of the flannel (or four-fold ordinary pocket
handkerchief) over the ear.</p>

<p>Now breathe strongly and steadily into the ear
through the covering thus made. Do this two or
three times, strongly willing the removal <a id="Ref_14" href="#BRef_14">of</a> the
pain. A warm, soothing influence will reach the
offending tooth, and peace will ensue. At the last
breath remove the handkerchief quickly, and the
pain will be gone.</p>

<p>A little success in this direction will enable you
to try your hand at more serious business.</p>

<p>Violent headaches—even arising from bilious
attacks—can be relieved in a remarkable way by
passes. Stand behind the patient, who should be
seated. Place your hands on the forehead.</p>

<p>Keep them there a little, and then make short
<em>passes in contact</em>, gently and firmly, with slight
pressure on the temples and backward over the
side and top head to the crown; then <em>draw out</em>
and shake your fingers as if you were throwing
water off them, and proceed again to make passes
as before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[15]</span></p>

<p>In from five to fifteen minutes relief will be
given, if the pain is not removed altogether.</p>

<p>In rheumatism and such diseases, in which pain
is a marked characteristic, Mesmerism “works
like a charm.”</p>

<p>The patient is always pleased to be relieved of
pain, and as the pain subsides, his mental and
physical conditions become more favorably receptive
to your <em>influence</em>. If, in treating a rheumatic
patient, a pain is moved—say from the
shoulder to the middle of the arm above the elbow—continue
your treatment, and, instead of <em>drawing
passes</em> to the fingers, endeavor to draw the
pain down to, and out of, the elbow joints.</p>

<p>If you are able to move the pain, if only an inch
from its original position, you have control over
it, and will be able, in due course, to remove it
altogether.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">How to Hypnotize a Bird.</h2>
</div>


<p>The ease with which even a child can put a dumb
creature into the hypnotic state is best illustrated
in the case of the bird, a most convenient subject.</p>

<p>Hold the bird securely, but gently, in the hand,
back downward. Look straight into its eyes. The
little creature will at first struggle to escape, but
after a minute or two it becomes quiet. On first
attempts it may be difficult to fix the bird’s gaze,
but the fascination of the human eye will make
itself felt in the end, and the tiny subject will not
try to take its gaze off the hypnotizer. When it
has reached this stage, begin very slowly to
loosen the grasp.</p>

<p>As the pressure grows lighter the bird becomes
more under the influence of the charm exerted by
the firm gaze. The beating of its heart, which
can easily be felt in the fingers, becomes more
rapid, the legs contract slightly and the lids draw
over the edges of the eyes. There must be almost
no pressure of the hand now, or the bird will not
sleep deeply.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, sometimes two, sometimes
five or ten, the eyelids will have entirely closed.
Still hold the bird carefully for two or three minutes.
It may now be handled freely but gently.
Held by the foot, head downward, its body is entirely
limp, like a bird just shot. It may be tossed
about without awaking so long as it is not dropped
or hurt in any way.</p>
